# chat
A simple chat application created with nodejs.

This chat is mainly an experimental project based on the socket.io tutorial. Later this chat was integrated into the https://paste.camp/ project, and development was continued further on that project.

This version could use some improvements, such as:
  - fix vulnerabilities to XSS by sanitizing the user inputs
  - let the client decide what to do with the raw chat messages rather than format them on the server side
